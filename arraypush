//Write a function that takes in an array and callback function. The Callback function checks to see if the value is greater than 10. Use the callback function to check each element in an array if the element if greater than 10 push it into a new array if not leave it out.

```[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90]```
Expected answer would be
```[10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90]```
